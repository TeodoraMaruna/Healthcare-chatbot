        "question": "i am not sure if i have rosacea. please help.",
        "answer": "Rosacea is a long-term inflammatory skin condition that causes reddened skin and a rash, usually on the nose and cheeks. On the other hand, you may have acne. mild steroid and antibiotic cream is the most effective drugs for acne and usually first choice in severe acne or cystic acne or acne not responding adequately to traditional anti-acne medications. acne is a recurrent condition and once your acne is brought under good control with oral and topical anti-acne medicines you should still continue to use a cream/gel (topical retinoid) for maintenance.  topical treatment of acne mainly revolves around topical antibacterials (clindamycin gel or nadifloxacin gel) benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids. topical retinoids are ideal for maintenance because they are  anti-inflammatory thereby preventing the formation of new acne. other than acne people with rosacea have redness of face and dry skin associated with burning sensation."
